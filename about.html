<h3>About us</h3>
<p>
<ul>
We are a group of people interested in hacking/coding. We are programmers who love doing what we do, and our mission is to contribute patches/fixes/software upstream to the various opensource systems, for the betterment of technology, hence mankind (or just because someone or ourself we need it)
<br><br>
We have as aim, to create the passion of programming into the minds of the newer generation of Mauritian hackers, we want to push the limit of the Mauritian programmer. We believe such a step to be a great opportunity for the whole island, as after all, imagine how investors would love to know there are world class developers here too. 
<br><br>
Many a times, there is that image of the lonesome hacker, coding in his basement or in his room, :) Let's change that, let's be a strong team, let's hack together.
<br> <br>
We also are a group of folks who love having fun and having some beers now and then.
<br><br>

ps. We are not OS biased, we do need hackers from different platforms. If you have been contributing to other platforms, ping us and get under the same umbrella.
